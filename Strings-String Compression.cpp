/*
Take as input S, a string. Write a function that does basic string compression. Print the value returned. E.g. for input “aaabbccds” print out a3b2c2ds.

Input Format
A single String S.

Constraints
A string of length between 1 to 1000

Output Format
The compressed String.

Sample Input
aaabbccds
Sample Output
a3b2c2ds
Explanation
In the given sample test case 'a' is repeated 3 times consecutively, 'b' is repeated twice, 'c' is repeated twice. But, 'd' and 's' occurred only once that's why we do not write their occurrence.
